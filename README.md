# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Your Task

Your assignment is to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.


Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:


- What was your motivation?
My motivation was to be able to understand and create a note taker application
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I built this project in order to expand on my skills on Express.js and backend development
- What problem does it solve?
It solves the problem of creating a note taker to write and save notes.
- What did you learn?
I honestly learned more about Express.js and how to utilize it.


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

First a github repository needs to be created make sure it has a README.md file, then clone the repository and paste it in your Week 11 folder. Then open the developer folder in the class repository and copy the material inside the folder into the repository folder. Then you can continue work on the assignment.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

CHARLES PUENTE-MATOS ONE OF THE TUTORING TEACHERS ASSISTED ME ON PART OF THIS ASSIGNMENT!
I DID USE YOUTUBE AND OTHER SITES TO HELP ME IMPLEMENT AND COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF CODE THAT I AM USING!!!

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application

>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
